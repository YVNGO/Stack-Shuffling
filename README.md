# Stack-Shuffling
There are 3 stacks A B and S, where stack B and S are empty initially. There are only two kinds of movement. (1)Top element of A can only be moved onto the top of S. (2)Top element of S can only be moved onto the top of B. By repeating (1) and (2) until A and S are empty, all elements in A will be moved to B and the elements in B are permuted (the order may not be the same). So here comes the problem. Given the initial order of elements in stack A and a final order of elements in B, can you cleverly judge whether the final order is possible to achieve? Input The input contains multiple test cases. The first line of input is an integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line gives an integer 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 3000) indicating the number of elements in stack A, the following line gives 𝑛 integers representing the corresponding elements in stack A (first element is bottom, last element is top and we guarantee that all the elements are  distinct). Then, the next line contains an integer 𝑚 (𝑚 &lt;= 200) telling you how many permutations you have to judge and in each of the following 𝑚 lines there are 𝑛 integers indicating the desired elements to be tested in stack B. Output If the permutation is possible to achieve, print "Aye" otherwise print "Impossible" in a separate line.
